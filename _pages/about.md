I am currently a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Prof. Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/) at S-Lab, [College of Computing and Data Science of Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), Singapore. Before that, I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2022 and my B.Eng. degree in Information Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2020. 

My research interest includes Distributed Training, Systems for Graph Learning and Machine Learning for Systems.
